The project has been boostrapped with the Yeoman scaffolding tool, using the [angular-fullstack] (https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) generator. While the Yeoman tool itself may not be mandatory for the project to run, it offers some helpful generators for routes, services etc.
